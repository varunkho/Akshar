for conversion:
1. Delete all unnecessary html around and within (including not needed columns).
2. Properly set the table's id, header row and bottom of the table.
3. Replace " class=b" with "".
4. Replace "    " with "" (it would delete indentation before TDs).
5. Replace "  <T" with "<T" (it would delete indentation before TRs).
6. Using regular expression search, replace "\<tr\>\n\<td\>" with "<TR><TD>" (it will delete new line between TRs and TDs).
7. Using regular expression search, replace "\</td\>\n\<td\>" with "</TD><TD>" (it will delete new line between TDs of individual TRs).
