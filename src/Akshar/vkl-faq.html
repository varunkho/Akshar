<h1 >Creating Virtual Keyboard Layout (VKL): Frequently Asked Questions</h1>
<dl>
 <dt>What is VKL?</dt>
<dd>A VKL is an XML file that contains key/character mappings. Every key on a keyboard has a unique scan code (a number) which is provided to the operating system when a key is pressed. Although these scan codes may differ from one keyboard vender to another, the operating system hides this peculiarity by substituting these scan codes with standard key codes. So, while creating a VKL, you specify what character is generated when a particular key is pressed.</dd>
<dt>What is the difference between Key based and Character based VKL?</dt>
<dd>In a Key based VKL, you specify what character is generated for a particular key code; on the other hand, in a Character based VKL, you specify a character against character. This means that in the latter case, when a particular character is generated by the system (regardless of the key pressed and key code generated), only then the associated character will be printed by VKM. Surely, Character based VKL is subject to the keyboard layout loaded within the system itself and is provided to overcome the problem of varying key codes within operating systems from different vendors. (Though its applicability is still a subject of scrutiny.)</dd>
<dt>What is a sequence?</dt>
<dd>A sequence allows users to create keystroke sequences. The first keystroke (also known as parent map) does not cause any character to be printed. Rather, it begins a sort of sub VKL such that when you press the next keystroke, it will be mapped against the sub mappings you've defined for this parent map.</dd>
<dt>What is a rule?</dt>
<dd>A rule defines “When this key is pressed, output this character if and only if, the cursor is adjacent to a particular text in a particular direction replacing that text.” The direction can be either right or left: 
<ul>
<li>Right captures the current character (where cursor is positioned) and characters that follow it for rule matching, </li>
<li>Left captures characters preceding the current character (where cursor is positioned) excluding it for rule matching.</li>
</ul>
<br />
There are two types of Rules:
<ul>
<li>Text — used to look for a literal text
<li>Range — used to look for a range of characters (using simple [] regular expression patterns).
</ul>
<br />
A rule cannot match more than 3 characters and cannot have spaces to be matched.
